## Solar Power Calculations

The solar constant in orbit is approximately 1,360 W/m². With panel efficiency η ≈ 25%, usable flux is about 340 W/m².

Area required for 5 GW of power:

$$
A = \frac{5 \times 10^9\ \text{W}}{340\ \text{W/m}^2} \approx 14.7\ \text{km}^2
$$

## Stefan-Boltzmann Law

Radiative heat transfer:

$$
P = \epsilon \sigma A (T^4 - T_{\text{env}}^4)
$$

Where ε = emissivity (~0.9), σ = 5.67 × 10⁻⁸ W/m²K⁴, and T = temperature in Kelvin.

## Capacity Factor

For solar with 20% capacity factor:

$$
25\ \text{GW} \times 0.2 = 5\ \text{GW}
$$

Battery duration at 5 GW draw:

$$
\frac{70\ \text{GWh}}{5\ \text{GW}} = 14\ \text{hours}
$$
